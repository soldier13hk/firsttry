#FYPFirstTry
This is the first version of the smart home app of my FYP.
It consists of a login page with firebase authentication using b@gmail.com and pw:b12345, and basic layout of devices using react-navigation and react-router.

To run the app, you have to have npm installed.
```
git clone "this repository"
cd FirstTry
npm i
react-native run-ios
react-native run-android
```

After the building of package,
```
react-native start
```
and reload the app.
